# aimboosterbot
This is a bot that will give you aimbot in the game aimbooster. Since the game is bounded to my screen of 1920x1080, the program uses a for loop between those pixels in order to set the cursor position and click. If you are running on the same resolution, make sure to set it to fullscreen in order for it to work.
